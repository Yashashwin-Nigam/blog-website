            <p class="post-description">Sustainability will continue as an element of many food trends in 2024, just as it was a key food trend of the past few years. The availability of ingredients farmed responsibly with lower-impact growing methods will expand the movement in important ways.Leading the charge: grains and other crops grown with concern for soil health, creating an easier environment for continued cultivation. Increasing interest in plant-forward dining will also carry forward the idea of careful cuisine. And the explosion of non-meat protein alternatives continuing into next year will highlight a desire for mindful options among the many food trends of 2024. Learning to prepare food this way may be an adjustment, but once you get started, you'll find the options are abundant. </p>
